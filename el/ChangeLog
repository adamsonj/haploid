	* haploid-bug.el (haploid-bug-get-bug): changed searching
	procedure so that we now include the whole body up to "^Version";
	this will allow us to include patches in bug reports
	(nil): added a menu item as a submenu of tools; Customize group
	now works just fine

	* haploid-bug.el: mostly working; it may now receive its own bug
	reports!

	* haploid-bug.el (haploid-bug-get-bug): this function now works;
	the error message in the t-clause displays with quotation marks,
	this is a bug in itself!
