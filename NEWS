* Major changes in Haploid Version 0.21 <2010-04-16 14:56 >

** fixed a bug in sparse.c that incorrectly indexed
   sparse elements

** Removed OpenMP from rec.c

   OpenMP directives should only be used in applications until further notice

** Lowered required version of Autoconf to 2.59,
   since that is the lowest version I have encountered on a machine
   that I need to use
   
* Major changes in Haploid Version 0.2 <2010-03-29 10:25 >

Haploid Version 0.2 includes totally new algorithms!
