This file describes how to compile and install Haploid, a C library
for haploid population genetic simulations.

Compiling
=========

Compiling Haploid follows the usual autotools routine:

# ./configure 
# make

If you obtained development code from the Subversion repository, then
run

# automake -a
# autoconf

before running ./configure.

You really should use gcc to compile the library.  The library makes use
of some GNU extensions and some C99 features, such as variable-length arrays.

To install the library, use

# make install

Usually you need root privileges to use make install.

Configure options
=================

Debugging
=========

To compile a version of the library for debugging use

# make -k CFLAGS=-O0

This command disables optimization so the debugger can read symbols
within library functions.
